# Translations

## Summary

We use a library called [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) for internationalization (i18n).

It creates the ability to use references (keys) to point to translation values based on various natural languages. Currently we have translations for English (by default) and Spanish. The translations are found in en.yaml and es.yaml.

Any content provided by design needs to be added to the en.yaml. All content is submitted by design to General Counsel (GC). After it is approved by GC, we do the Spanish translations, which are added to the es.yaml (Note: we are working on tooling to simplify translations)

## Tips and Tricks for adding content

- en.yaml is a very long file. See if your IDE has bookmarks, and use them to mark your spot
- en.yaml is organized by content type (subsubsections, headings, info, dataviews, fields)
- When implementing several screens, input by content component type rather than screen content. For example, input all the headings of each of the screens since they will be next to each other in the yaml file. Then do all the InfoDisplay content, then Modal content, etc).
- You can interpolate any (non-nested) fact value into the content using double curly brackets (ex. \`{{/taxYear}})
- If your content string starts with interpolation (ex `{{/secondaryFiler/firstName}}`), you need to wrap the string in double quotes
- Use a proper apostrophe char `â€™`instead of a single quote `'` when an apostrophe is needed. On a Mac, the shortcut is `Option + Shift + ]`(there is a test for this, and search and replace may be the most efficient way to do this when copying and pasting from design)
- To reference existing content within the yaml, use the syntax `$t(path./to-value)`([for reference](https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/nesting))
- `>-` basically means 'newline' in yaml

### What is migrateScenarios?

Why? When a change in the codebase requires that all jsons contain new facts or updates to existing facts, this script can be used to update all of the files at once.

How? The script does not automatically detect anything or run automatically.

* The eng who made the change to the codebase should change this script to update the facts as needed.
* In most cases only the section between MIGRATION START and MIGRATION END will need to be updated.
* Then the eng runs this script and commits the updated jsons. `npm run migrate-scenarios`

Note that even though it is checked in, this script runs only once to update all the scenario jsons.

### Can someone explain the distinction between categories, subcategories, and subsubcategories in the codebase and why i MUST have a subsubcategory according to my console?

* Categories and subcategories appear in the checklist
* Each subcategory may have 1-2 items of data in the checklist
* Each subcategory has a dataview, which is a summary of the subcategory.
* In some cases the dataview might just be a screen within the subcategory (`<Screen actAsDataView={true} />`)
* But in most cases the dataview is a new page which shows all the subsubcategories.
* The subsubcategories in the dataview have multiple items of data and an edit button.
* The subsubcategory edit button takes you to those screens in the flow.
* Then you will be in review mode and on completion of the screens in that subsubcategory, get redirected back to the dataview.
* Every screen must be in a subsubcategory with the following exceptions
  * If a screen is the only screen in a subcategory AND it is marked with `actAsDataview`
  * If a screen is not editable, can be placed inside a subcategory. In this case, the screen will only be shown to a taxpayer on their first pass of the screens- it will not show up in review mode.

### What's a scenario?

As a client enters information in the Direct File (DF) application, the application accumulates these facts. These accumulated facts is sometimes called the "client factgraph json". This json file can represent almost any situation, and they essentially represent one user's tax situation or _scenario_.

So we store them and use them to test different user scenarios. We have a few hundred pre-defined scenarios. These scenarios lay the foundation for testing various parts of our app. As we add scope, we may add more scenarios.

### Why don't we call scenarios fact graphs or vice versa?

I guess we could, but to allow some distinction between any fact graph and this set of fact graphs that represent different user tax return situations, we introduced the concept of scenarios.

Scenarios are a subset of factgraphs as they are required to be complete - as in, the person got to the sign and submit screen and there were no submission blocking errors.

### What tests should I run if making screen changes or fact changes?

It kinda depends on what is changing in the screen. If the screen order changes then the `flowSnapshots` tests would capture this. When facts change there can be a whole cascade of tests that can test this change. Our recommendation is to follow this [mural](https://app.mural.co/t/usdigitalservice0135/m/usdigitalservice0135/1722960219541/36%5B%E2%80%A6%5D510295f8a2727fd347e319714a73c?sender=u609b185fbd158566f8103243) and walk through each step when making fact changes. There are 4 steps and each step has instructions on what tests to run.

### What do flowSnapshots do and why do I have 100 errors?

flowSnapshots are making sure the order of the screens are what we expect them to be for each scenario.

The way it works is that it runs through the scenario, as though the user is clicking through screens and stores the sequence of screens seen. Then that sequence is stored, so that we can test that it doesn't change accidentally.

If some new screen was added that will be shown to the users represented by lots of scenarios, that sequence will now change and not match what was stored. So when the flowSnapshot test ran it updated all snapshots and you may be seeing many errors.

If the change you see in the files is what was expected based on the change you made in your PR, you can simply check in the new sequence.

### What are we doing when we SetFactAction?

Sometimes we need to set a fact when the tax payer (TP) reaches a screen, regardless of their input. In other words, "when a TP reaches this screen, set this fact".

### Does `npm run test` run all the frontend tests?

Yes, `npm run test` runs all the frontend vite tests. There are two other tests that may be helpful:

* `npm run test:ci` - which runs all tests from the CI/CD pipeline (ie, when a PR is opened or committed to) except the completenessTests and functionalFlowTests.
* `npm run test:ci:2` - runs the completenessTests and functionalFlowTests

### When do facts need to be sent "downstream" or sent to "mef"?

Our fact dictionary is broken into modules. Each fact dictionary module is an XML fie. Here's a list of them as of the time of writing this answer:

![Screenshot 2024-08-21 at 4.02.16  PM.png](uploads/a6af72545ca2a2b0bb18da9eb1f30267/Screenshot_2024-08-21_at_4.02.16_PM.png){width="281" height="822"}

With `elderlyAndDisabled.xml` selected, opening this file, we see:

![Screenshot 2024-08-21 at 4.02.06  PM.png](uploads/d84c34f216cf1c5c4d9fdb53a6eae640/Screenshot_2024-08-21_at_4.02.06_PM.png){width="1063" height="822"}A few things we notice that the first line of this file designates this to be a fact dictionary. The first fact has the export statement of:

* Export mef="true" downstreamFacts="true"

Certain facts are needed by other modules, if/when a fact is needed by another module, you can specify `downstreamFacts="true"`. Another advantage is testing. Fact that we're exporting for reuse in other modules should probably have tests.

You do not need to set downstreamFacts in order to write the value in a PDF, that process is just another way of displaying the value and is not subject to dependency management.

A few things to keep in mind

1. Always run the `npm run watch-fact-dictionary` so that any changes to any fact dictionary module will automatically re-build the dictionary
2. To validate your fact dictionary changes, you can run `npm run verify-module-dependencies`. This will let you know if some facts are in error or if you are missing the `mef` or `downstreamFacts` attribute on any fact definition.

### Adding new collection aliases are weird

Indeed. In the filers.xml fact dictionary module, you will sometimes see facts with a \_`*` eg, `/filers/`\_`*/firstName`. This would be a _collection_. Each collection is made up of _collection items._ In this case, the filers collection is made up of two items, namely the primary and secondary UUIDs.

Lets say we wanted to operate on that collection, by e.g., filtering it. When we filter that collection, the resulting collection could be

1. \[primaryUUID, secondaryUUID\]
2. \[primaryUUID\]
3. \[secondaryUUID\]
4. \[\]

This filtered collection, doesn't have access to the other facts in the filers module. For example, `/filers/*/MiddleInitial` or `/filers/*/dateofBirth`. In order to access these other facts, we use aliases.

There are two files responsible for aliases, ie, aliases.ts and dependencyGraph.ts

### What's the deal with Placeholders?

Placeholders help set the value but don't make a fact complete.To answer your questions more directly, placeholders mean that a value of a fact will never be blank. Once a fact is written we generally don't provide ways to clear out written facts. The reason they don't work as a proper default is that we also end up checking if a fact is complete in a couple of different spots.

### What is the difference between a fact in the dictionary with a value put in \<Placeholder\> tags and a fact in the dictionary with just a value assigned but no Placeholder tag 

So we have a concept of writable facts and derived facts where writable facts are those that the user can update and derived facts that are just "calculated" values.  "Placeholders" I believe are only supported for writable facts as the intention is that the user should potentially override them with a written value. Derived facts can just be static values like in the example you gave. I would consider it to be more of a constant than a default value, but that's likely just a jargon/pedantic distinction. This is a default value in the sense that this value will not really change.

### What about \<ExportZero/\>?

By default, facts with value zero are not sent to PDF or XML generation. This tag overrides that behavior for a fact, so that the zero will be included in the outputs.

Note that it is possible to conditionally export zero values by using this tag on a fact that conditionally leaves its value unspecified (incomplete). PDF generation automatically ignores incomplete fact values, producing the effect of a "blank" output. XML mappings can use the Optional syntax to get a similar result.

### How does one deal with the requirement of export zero dollar values, **sometimes**, **conditionally**?

TBD

### How are data view created?

Some info [here](flow/dataviews.md)

### When can we use which fact types when writing facts?

When creating facts the first question to ask is, is the fact a writable fact or a derived fact. If the fact is writable. then generally speaking we will require it to use one of the factTypes, to calculate a new fact based on some other fact (called a Dependency).

### \[ERROR\] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin:3.13.0:compile (default-compile) on project directfile-api: Fatal error compiling: error: release version 21 not supported

In the event that anyone else has ran into the issue of `./mvnw` ignoring `JAVA_HOME`, I discovered that at some point in my past, I created a `~/.mavenrc`  file that overrode `JAVA_HOME` to a specific version number, but only when running maven.  Deleting that file caused `./mvnw` to use the correct version.

### How to create a knockout?

In summary there are 3 steps:

1. Create the fact that will be responsible to knockout the TP
2. Add the Screen that will use the fact created in Step 1 and set `isKnockout={true}` on it.
3. Add the newly created fact from Step 1 to the `/flowIsKnockedOut` fact in flow.xml.

### Headings vs InfoDisplays?

Every screen has a `Heading` and yes they are sometimes long. Every screen can only have one `Heading`.

Usually the top most text on every screen is the `Heading`. I believe in some cases there is a section header above the header. `InfoDisplay`s handles a lot of flexible content as you can put "html" inside it. Most explanatory text would use `InfoDisplay` by default.

You can have more than one `InfoDisplay` in a screen but not more than one `Heading`.

### When we have a screen where we calculated a bunch of stuff to show to the tp, but it isn't a writable field - these results don't show up in the `dataview`. it seems weird not to have them. How do we add a non-field piece of info to the `dataview` for that `subsubcategory`?

What you may be be looking for is `displayOnlyOn` property. You can add this to any of the content declaration types we have like Dollar or String with the corresponding fact and set the `displayOnlyOn`  to `data-view` .  We have a handful of examples of this within the CreditSubsection.

### My test is failing with \`Invalid UUID string: undefined

You may need to add a a line here in the test file:

```jsx
const collectionIdMap = {
    [`/flow/you-and-your-family/about-you`]: primaryFilerId, 
    [`/flow/you-and-your-family/spouse`]: primaryFilerId, 
    [`/flow/you-and-your-family/dependents`]: dependentId, 
    [`/flow/income/jobs`]: w2Id, 
    [`/flow/income/interest`]: interestReportId, 
    [`/flow/income/unemployment`]: formId, 
    [`/flow/income/retirement`]: retirementForm1099Id, 
    [`/flow/income/apf`]: apfForm1099Id,
    [`/flow/income/social-security`]: reportId, };``
```

### What is All-Screens and where can I find it?

All screens is a page that displays every screen in the application and the conditionals for that page. The URL for local development is at http://localhost:3000/df/file/all-screens/index.html

### What's the difference between `DFAlert`, `Assertion` ,  `TaxReturnAlert` , `MefAlert`, `FactAssertion`, and  `FactResultAssertion` ?

`<DFAlert>` has no special behavior and just renders content on a screen like normal

`<Assertion>` is used for alerts that should show up only in the SubCategory dataview screen

`<TaxReturnAlert>` is rendered in a specific screen and an aggregated alert summary on the checklist and dataview pages

* If `type='error'`  and the alert's conditions are true, submission will be blocked until the filer makes the necessary updates to fix the error.
* If `type='warning'`  does not block submission and just directs the user to review the data on the screen in which it is present
* If the type is set to anything else, the alert will not render under any conditions (this is likely something we should prevent, but may have been unintentional)
* We currently use these to prompt filers to remove any income items associated with a secondary filer if they change their status to anything other than Married Filing Jointly.

`<MefAlert>`  are used when an alert is based on the response from MEF and not something we can determine in advance and the error is correctable.

* These will only ever render when a tax return is rejected.  They are configured with an `mefErrorCode`  that is returned from MEF and linked to the user's return separately from the fact graph and is a required condition for displaying the alert.
* These alerts also bubble up to the checklist and dataviews just as with `<TaxReturnAlert>`  and have the same behaviors with the `type`  attribute.
* Additional conditions on `<MefAlert>` nodes are used when we are able to determine whether the cause of the error has been resolved and can hide/remove the alert.
* As an example, the `IND-180-01` MEF error code is set if the user submits a return claiming that they have no IP Pin but the IRS has records saying that they do.  This prompts a blocking `<MefAlert>` to be displayed that will only become inactive once the user answers that they do, in fact, have a PIN and enter it.
* If we have no way know for certain whether the user has corrected the problem, we should make sure the alert is set to warning, so the user can resubmit once they believe they have corrected the issue.

`<TaxReturnAlert>`  and `<MefAlert>` are both aggregated from the screen config so that we can direct them all the way from the checklist, down to the specific screen(s) they belong to.

`<FactAssertion>`, `<FactResultAssertion>`, and the `outcomeI18nKey`/`resultI18nKey` keys are used to display alerts that only bubble up to the dataview and collection screens and are primarily used in the dependents and qualifying persons section.

Lastly, "Cues & Aggregators" area of this 2023 Mural board does a good job explaining [how the alerts work](https://app.mural.co/t/usdigitalservice0135/m/usdigitalservice0135/1679591477411/ca7cc4ebdd42dfd9a3ee5ea57153b0135df9971f?wid=0-1701705425590). Documentation from Jen in the  [design wiki - TODO](), should mirror what's on that 2023 Mural.

### I have to create some checkboxes and can use MultiEnum or Booleans as checkboxes. When should I use one over the other?

Use MultiEnum if

* All your checkboxes need to packaged into a single fact as a Set/List and needs to sent to MeF

Use Boolean if

* You need access to those checkbox values later on in the flow

### Why does this Fact error out with \`java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: must use getVect to access...

Can you see the problem with the code below?

```jsx
    <Fact path="/cdccCareProviders/*/isHouseholdEmployeeNo">
      <Name>Is Not a Household Employee</Name>
      <Description>Whether care provider is not a household employee. Used for the f2441 PDF 'No'
        checkbox</Description>

      <Derived>
        <Not>
          <Dependency path="/cdccCareProviders/*/isHouseholdEmployee" />
        </Not>
      </Derived>
    </Fact>
```

The problem lies in the following fact: `/cdccCareProviders/*/isHouseholdEmployee`. Is this fact, complete and true?

To fix this issue, this fact:

```jsx
<Dependency path="/cdccCareProviders/*/isHouseholdEmployee" />`
```

should be

```jsx
<Dependency path="../isHouseholdEmployee" />
```

The error is telling you, you need to use get vect because the original `/cdccCareProviders/*/isHouseholdEmployee` is an array since we don't have the context for the `*`.\
If we use the `../isHouseholdEmployee` we are referencing the same id in the main fact so we would only get a single value here instead of an array.

### I need to set a limit for a fact based on the value of another fact. How do I do it?

There's been some discussion on setting up dynamic fact limits for field level validation, but field level validation alone would not work because you could change the limiting fact so `TaxReturnAlert` is used instead. `<TaxReturnAlert>` has the advantage that if you go back and make edits that would change the validity of that fact, you'll be directed to the now-invalid fact. The downside is the user is not immediately notified of the error.

### How do I format a recent factgraph module that I changed?

Navigate to the project you are working on (backend, submit, etc) and run \`./mvnw spotless:apply\`

### How to capitalize an Enum using existing CompNodes?

```jsx
<ToUpper>
  <AsString>
    <Dependency module="filers" path="/filerResidenceAndIncomeState" />
  </AsString>
</ToUpper>
```
