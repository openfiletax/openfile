**Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend (Form 1099-MISC)**
---------------------------------------------------

Taxpayers from Alaska:

-  Will now have the ability to add their Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend
   (Form 1099-MISC) in Direct File
-  With 1099-MISC income that is not from the Alaska Permanent Fund will
   not be able to use Direct File
-  Who received income from a state other than Alaska during 2024 they
   will not be able to use Direct File
-  That have a child who needs to report their Alaska Permanent Fund
   Dividend (1099-MISC) cannot yet do that in Direct File. This is
   because reporting a child’s unearned income requires either of the
   below forms, both of which are currently out of scope:

   -  Form 8814, Parent’s Election to Report Child’s Interest and
      Dividends **OR**
   -  Form 8615, Tax for Certain Children Who Have Unearned Income

-  Taxpayers who do not live and earn income exclusively in Alaska
   cannot report a PFD or any other form of income on the 1099-MISC.
-  The Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend can also be referred to as “PFD,”
   or “the dividend”

**Navigation**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*How do you navigate to this screen in the Direct File experience?*

For now, taxpayers will only be able to add the Form 1099-MISC **only**
if it is for an Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend.

In the **About You** section, the taxpayer will:

1. Indicate if they are an Alaskan resident
2. Confirm if they received an Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend

If both of the above are true, then the taxpayer will have an Alaska
Permanent Fund Dividend sub-section listed in the checklist’s Income
section.

**Retirement income Form 1099-R**
---------------------------------

Taxpayers will now have the ability to add some pension and annuity
income (Form 1099-R) in Direct File starting in March **2025.** This is
the template `Form
1099-R <https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-r>`__ that the TP
will be using to fill out DF.

**Before March 2025**

If a taxpayer indicates they have any 1099-R income, they will be told
that they can’t use Direct File yet, but that the feature will be
available in March.

**After March 2025**

Taxpayers will be able to file returns with 1099-R income within the
Supported Income Types listed below. Taxpayers who were previously told
they were ineligible because of this income should be able to complete
and file their return.

**Supported Income Types**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Briefly describe the new feature and how it impacts the taxpayer’s
experience.*

-  Form 1099-R is used to report a variety of income types, only some of
   which will be supported by Direct File this year

-  Supported income types include 1099-R forms where the Box 7
   **Distribution code** matches any one of the following options,
   unless any of the exclusions in “Unsupported income types” applies
   below:

   -  2
   -  7
   -  G
   -  H
   -  2B / B2
   -  7B / B7

-  Unsupported income types

   -  | BG / GB

   -  | 4G / G4

   -  4H / H4

   -  1099-R income where box 2a **Taxable amount** is left blank

   -  1099-R income where box 2b **Taxable amount not determined** is
      checked

   -  Lump sum distributions for taxpayers born before January 2, 1936
      (would require the unsupported form 4972)

   -  1099-R income where box 3 **Capital Gain** has a nonzero value

   -  1099-R income where box 6 **Net unrealized appreciation in
      employer’s securities** has a nonzero value

   -  1099-R income where the **IRA / SEP / SIMPLE** box is checked

   -  1099-R income where box 7 **Distribution Code** has a value other
      than those listed in the supported income types

   -  | 1099-R income with a taxable amount in box 2a as part of a
        rollover (box 7, codes that include G or H)

   -  | 1099-R income that the taxpayer rolled over after receiving the
        distribution. Note that direct rollovers are supported.

   -  | 1099-R income that qualifies as a disaster recovery distribution

   -  Distributions to public safety officers to pay for premiums for
      accident, health, or long-term insurance.

   -  1099-R income where box 8 **Other** has a value greater than $0

   -  1099-R income where box 10 **Amount allocable to IRR within 5
      years** has a value greater than $0.

   -  1099-R income where box 12 **FACTA Filing requirement** is checked

   -  1099-R income where box 13 **Date of payment** is not left blank.

   -  1099-R income where the State listed in box 15 does not match the
      taxpayer’s income and residence state, unless the 1099-R is for a
      nontaxable rollover with no state withholding:

      -  Allowed situations:

         -  Box 15 is blank
         -  Box 15 state matches the filer’s income + residence state
         -  Box 15 state doesn’t match the filer’s income + residence
            state but the 1099-R box 7 distribution code includes ``G``
            or ``H``

      -  All other 1099-Rs with a value for box 15 are not in scope.

Taxpayers are asked to report retirement income / 1099-Rs in the Income
section, after interest income. If taxpayers do not have any to report,
they can proceed by choosing the
**``I don't have any 1099-Rs to report`` option.**

**Rejection reasons**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following new rejection reasons may be experienced by taxpayers who
report 1099-R income:

**Interest Income requiring Schedule B**
----------------------------------------

Tax payers with more than $1,500 of interest or dividend income are
*required* to file a Schedule B. In the previous tax-year, these
tax-payers were not supported in Direct File.

For TY 2024 we’ve added support for tax payers who are required to file
a Schedule B, but only the most common situations.

**Supported tax situations**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Tax payers with more than $1,500 of interest reported on 1099-INT(s)

**Unsupported tax situations**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Any dividend income (**1099-DIV**)
-  Amortizable bond, interest, and premiums (**1099-INT**) including:
   Specified Private Activity Bonds & Interest, Market Discounts,
   Tax-Exempt bonds
-  Original issue discount treated as interest income (**1099-OID**)
-  Foreign income, accounts, or trusts **FBAR**:

   -  Tax payers with ownership or transactions with foreign assets or
      accounts may be required to file additional forms with the IRS and
      other authorities. (Those forms are not supported in Direct File)
   -  Failure to file those forms could result in penalties.

-  Seller financed mortgage interest (**1099-INT & 1098**):

   -  Tax payers who receive interest income from a seller financed
      mortgage are required to provide detailed information about the
      payer of that interest (including name, address, SSN, and use of
      property).
   -  Tax payers are also required to issue Form 1098 to payers of
      seller financed mortgage interest.
   -  There may be penalties associated to improper reporting of this
      tax situation

-  Nominee interest (**1099-INT & 1096**)

   -  Tax payers acting as nominees (receiving interest on behalf of
      another) are required to issue forms to the owner of the interest
      as well as file additional forms to the IRS

-  Excludable interest (**1099-INT**)

   -  Tax payers with excludable interest from Series EE or I bonds used
      for education must file additional forms to the IRS those forms
      are not supported in direct file)
   -  This is a very rare case

-  Tax exempt interest (**1099-INT**)

**Premium Tax Credit (PTC)**
----------------------------

The Premium Tax Credit serves as a tax credit aimed to offset the cost
of health coverage for individuals who qualify and buy health insurance
through Healthcare.gov or a state Marketplace.

The user qualifies for the credit if:

-  Their health insurance plan is purchased through Healthcare.gov or a
   state Marketplace.
-  Their household income falls between 100% and 400% of the federal
   poverty level for your household size.
-  They don’t file as Married Filing Separately (with exceptions for
   victims of domestic abuse and spousal abandonment).
-  They can’t be claimed as a dependent by another person.

If you qualify, you can either take your tax credit as a monthly subsidy
to help pay for your insurance costs or claim the entire credit when you
file your tax return.

Once they make their decision, we will use the details from their 1095-A
to determine your Premium Tax Credit and complete Form 8962 to submit
with their tax return.

**TL;DR: What’s New for TY 2024?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **New Eligibility Group:** Taxpayers with Form 1095-A will now be
   able to check eligibility for the Premium Tax Credit (PTC).
-  **Expanded Form Support:** Taxpayers can file Form 8962 for claiming
   PTC and reconciling advance payments of the Premium Tax Credit
   (APTC).
-  **Enhanced User Guidance:** Taxpayers with changes in circumstances
   (unreported to the Marketplace) can now get guidance for looking up
   the second-lowest-cost Silver plan (SLCSP) premiums.

**In Scope for TY 2024**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the 2024 tax season, Direct File will allow taxpayers to:

1. **Claim the Premium Tax Credit (PTC)** – Taxpayers with 1095-A forms
   can use Direct File to determine eligibility for the PTC.
2. **Reconcile Advance Payments** – Taxpayers can reconcile their
   advance payments of the Premium Tax Credit (APTC) and calculate any
   repayments required.
3. **File Form 8962** – Direct File will guide taxpayers through filing
   Form 8962 to claim their PTC or reconcile APTC.

**Out of Scope for TY 2024**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some taxpayer scenarios are **not** supported by Direct File this year
due to complexity:

**Taxpayer Type Scenarios**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Self-Employed Taxpayers
-  Nonresident Taxpayers (Form 1040-NR)
-  Taxpayers with Dependents Who Have a Filing Requirement

**Form-Specific Scenarios**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Multiple Forms 1095-A
-  Policy Allocations Between Multiple Tax Families (Form 8962, Part IV)
-  Alternative Calculation for Year of Marriage (Form 8962, Part V)

**Specific Coverage Types**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Employer-Sponsored Plan Coverage (QSEHRAs and ICHRAs)
-  Taxpayers with Ineligible Immigration Status

**Error Handling & System Messages**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a taxpayer encounters an unsupported scenario (e.g., multiple
1095-A forms or self-employment income), Direct File will display the
following “knockout” message, rationale, and prompt the tax payer to
exit the return.

**About You Data Import**
-------------------------

About You and IP PIN data import will be live for all taxpayers at the
start of the tax filing season.

Rather than asking taxpayers to enter their basic biographical
information after providing it to ID.me, we will be importing that data
and showing it to the taxpayer to confirm. They can edit some of the
information if they wish.

The information we will prepopulate from ID.me is:

-  Name
-  Date of birth (New from last year: cannot edit)
-  Mailing address
-  Phone number
-  Email address (Already prepopulated, cannot edit)
-  SSN or ITIN (New from last year: cannot edit)
-  IP Pin (from TP’s online account)

For IP Pins:

-  This is only for the primary filer, not the spouse or dependents
-  If the TP does not have an IP PIN on file, we will not show them the
   page to input their IP pin
-  If the TP does have an IP PIN on file, we will import it from their
   online account
-  If we aren’t able to connect to the IP PIN service to know if they
   have one or not, we will default to last year’s flow (asking the TP
   if they have one and to input it if they do)

Biographical information comes from our “SADI” integration (which
provides us what the taxpayer provided to ID.me) and the IP PIN comes
from the IRS “IP PIN” service integration.

**W2 Data Import**
------------------

We plan to launch this feature at the start of the tax season to a
limited percentage of taxpayers to start and will increase the
percentage from there.

In order to help make it easier and more accurate for taxpayers to file
their tax return, we will allow them to choose to import W-2 information
the IRS has on file for them. For taxpayers selected for our pilot:

-  Taxpayers will be able to opt in to this feature
-  They will see a summary page with the W-2 information we have on file
   and they can select to import one or more of those W-2s or choose not
   to import those W-2s and manually enter their own as they do today.
-  Once the taxpayer imports a W-2, they will be able to view the
   information on the W-2 or remove it from their tax return.
-  We are not able to import Box 12, Box 14, and state tax information
   (Box 15-20) because that is not in our data source at the IRS from
   the SSA

For a select percentage of taxpayers, they will see the opportunity to
import W-2 information at the start of the “jobs” screens.

**How will CS know if the TP is using data imported vs. manual entry?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CS can ask taxpayers if they selected any W-2s that were already
available to import rather than typing it in manually. If more
confirmation is needed, reach out to the data import team who can look
up on our end whether they imported data. Suggested ways to ask:

-  Was a W-2 available for you to select when you reached the section
   where you input your jobs and W-2 income information?
-  Was there a box to check to bring in / import / select a W-2 with
   information already provided?

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Question                          | Answer                            |
+===================================+===================================+
| Where did you get my W-2          | Your employer reports your Form   |
| information?                      | W-2 information to the federal    |
|                                   | government every year. This       |
|                                   | information is what IRS has on    |
|                                   | file for you.                     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| What if I think something is      | If any of the information on your |
| incorrect on my W-2?              | W-2 isn’t correct, reach out to   |
|                                   | your employer and ask for an      |
|                                   | updated W-2. For now, please      |
|                                   | enter a new W-2 manually with the |
|                                   | correct information.              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| How do I edit my W-2 information? | Taxpayers can edit their W-2      |
|                                   | information after they import     |
|                                   | their W-2. After importing the    |
|                                   | W-2, there is a summary screen    |
|                                   | where taxpayers can choose to     |
|                                   | “edit” information.               |

| What if one of my W-2s is         | Here are some reasons why a Form  |
| missing?                          | W-2 might be missing from the     |
|                                   | list: **Your employer submitted   |
|                                   | your W-2 information to the       |
|                                   | federal government, but the IRS   |
|                                   | didn’t get it yet.** Most W-2s    |
|                                   | are submitted to the federal      |
|                                   | government by January 31. **You   |
|                                   | made less than $600 with an       |
|                                   | employer in this tax year**, so   |
|                                   | your employer isn’t required to   |
|                                   | file a W-2 for you. You’re still  |
|                                   | required to report all of your    |
|                                   | income. **We can only import      |
|                                   | standard W-2s**. If you have a    |
|                                   | nonstandard W-2 (handwritten,     |
|                                   | altered, or typed on a            |
|                                   | typewriter), we can’t import it   |
|                                   | for you. If you have a Form W-2c  |
|                                   | (a corrected W-2), review the W-2 |
|                                   | we imported for you to make sure  |
|                                   | the information is up to date.    |
|                                   | **We only support importing your  |
|                                   | W-2s, not your spouse’s.** You    |
|                                   | can manually add your spouse’s    |
|                                   | W-2s later on. If your W-2 isn’t  |
|                                   | in this list, you can manually    |
|                                   | add your W-2.                     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| How do I remove an imported W-2   | You can remove a W-2 you imported |
| after I imported it?              | by clicking the “Remove W-2”      |
|                                   | option at the top of the W-2      |

| changed since then?               | imported the information the IRS  |
|                                   | had on file from the SSA and your |

**1095-A Data Import**
----------------------

In order to help make it easier and more accurate for taxpayers to file
their tax return, and reduce rejections for TPs who don’t realize they
have marketplace insurance for the PTC, we will be warning TPs if we see
that they have a 1095-A in their online account.

-  If they have a 1095-A in their account, they’ll see a new page
   telling them they have one and where to get it
-  They will also see a warning on the page that asks if they have
   marketplace insurance
-  If the TP definitely doesn’t have a 1095-A, we will tell them we
   think they don’t have one.
-  Note, we are only checking for the primary filer, not the spouse or
   their dependents

For a select percentage of taxpayers, they will see these pages in the
Premium Tax Credit section

**Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)**
----------------------------------

**Description**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Direct File only supports simple HSA situations.

Situations currently supported in DF:

-  For contributions:

   -  You or your employer contributed to your HSA, and you had the same
      type of insurance coverage for all of 2024

-  For distributions:

   -  You only used HSA distributions to pay for qualified medical
      expenses
   -  You received a Form 1099-SA, and the distribution code is 1

Several exceptions apply. See *Unsupported Cases*, below, for specifics.

**Tax Forms**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Taxpayers must file Form 8889 if they had HSA activity in 2024, and
   in some circumstances if they filed form 8889 in 2023, regardless of
   activity in 2024.
-  Each filer with HSA activity reports that activity on Form 8889.
   (Filers married filing jointly may have 2 Forms 8889, one for each
   filer)
-  If either filer is eligible for an HSA deduction, that gets reported
   on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), Part II, line 13.

**Key facts about HSAs**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because HSAs are tax-advantaged, there are lots of rules around
contributions and distributions. Some highlights…

**Contribution rules**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to make HSA contributions, you must meet the following
requirements:

1. You are covered under a High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) on the
   first day of the month.
2. You have no other health coverage except certain allowed coverage.
   (Allowed coverage includes accident, disability, dental, and vision.
   See `Form 8889
   instructions <https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8889>`__ for more.)
3. You aren’t enrolled in Medicare.
4. You can’t be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s <TY> tax
   return.

There is an annual limit for how much a taxpayer can contribute to their
HSA each year. The calculation depends on:

-  The type of High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) coverage you have—For
   2024, if you have self-only coverage, your maximum contribution is
   $4,150. If you have family coverage, your maximum contribution is
   $8,300.
-  Which months you were considered eligible—You’re considered having
   HDHP coverage for all of a month if you had coverage on the first day
   of the month.
-  Your age—If you’re age 55 or older at the end of <TY>, the
   contribution limit is increased by $1,000 for your HSA.

If you follow the contribution rules, your contributions aren’t taxable
income.

2 important concepts:

-  Employer contributions vs other contributions

   -  Employer contributions—Most HSA contributions go through an
      employer. Either the contribution came from the employer, or it
      was a pre-tax deduction from your paycheck. These employer
      contributions are marked on Form W-2, box 12, code W, and are not
      included in taxable wages.
   -  Other contributions—In addition, taxpayers can also make
      contributions that aren’t through an employer. For example, they
      deposited money directly into their HSA through a bank account or
      check. These amounts get deducted from income through the HSA
      deduction.

-  In 2024 vs for 2024—Taxpayers are allowed to contribute to their HSAs
   (or remove excess contributions) up to the filing deadline. So if you
   make a contribution in January 2025, you can choose to assign it for
   2024. As a result, taxpayers file their federal tax return without
   necessarily having an income tax form that lists the correct amount
   of their HSA contributions. Therefore, there’s more burden on the
   taxpayer to provide the correct amount.

**Distribution rules**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While you’re only allowed to contribute to an HSA if you meet certain
requirements, you can take a distribution of the funds in an HSA at any
time to pay for qualified medical expenses.

-  HSA distributions are tax exempt, if they are spent on qualified
   medical expenses.
-  Any distributions not used for qualified medical expenses are taxable
   and subject to an additional 20% tax. The additional 20% tax doesn’t
   apply to distributions made after the account beneficiary:

   -  Dies
   -  Becomes disabled
   -  Turns age 65

-  Generally, qualified medical expenses for HSA purposes are medical
   expenses that weren’t covered by an insurance plan. They include many
   types of medical expenses (outlined in more detail in Publication
   502, Medical and Dental Expenses), as well as some general health
   expenses like nonprescription medication, tampons and pads, and
   personal protective equipment like masks and hand sanitizer.

HSA distributions are reported on Form 1099-SA.

**Direct File Scope for TY 2024**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Who needs to file**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our HSA questions allow Direct File to support tax situations where
filers need to include Form 8889 on their tax return. Form 8889 is
needed when:

-  A taxpayer, their employer, or someone on their behalf, made
   contributions for 2024 to their HSA.
-  A taxpayer received HSA distributions in 2024.
-  A taxpayer’s 2023 tax return received benefits from assuming the
   taxpayer would be eligible to make HSA contributions throughout 2024,
   and the taxpayer’s eligibility changed.

**Noteworthy features**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Direct File chooses the most advantageous division of HSA
   contribution limits for married filers based on their actual
   contributions.

   -  Generally, filers who are married and have a family HDHP plan
      split their HSA contribution limit evenly. Some exceptions apply
      based on filer age.
   -  Spouses can agree to split that contribution limit differently.
   -  Filers who use the Married Filing Jointly (MFJ) status where both
      spouses make HSA contributions may notice that Direct File does
      not evenly allocate their HSA contributions.

      -  Direct File will allocate contribution limits for MFJ filers
         who share a family plan to ensure that the taxpayers receive
         the maximum deduction on their HSA contributions. This often
         means that the contribution limits are assigned unevenly.

**Unsupported cases**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Direct File doesn’t support:

-  | Changes in marital status or coverage that affect your contribution
     limit. This includes getting married, not being covered by a
     High-Deductible Health Plan all year, or switching between
     self-only and family plans.

-  Situations where you owe additional tax.

   -  Taxpayers who made contributions to their HSA for 2024 but were
      *not eligible* to make contributions throughout *all* of 2024.

      -  Taxpayers who could be claimed as dependents
      -  Taxpayers who had Medicare for any part of the year
      -  Taxpayers who had disqualifying coverage for any part of the
         year

   -  Contributions to an HSA in excess of the filer’s 2024 contribution
      limit, even if they’re withdrawn before <Tax Day>. Excess
      contributions could happen because the taxpayer:

      -  Contributed over the contribution limit
      -  Weren’t actually eligible to contribute
      -  Left excess contributions in their account from a previous year
      -  A taxpayer’s 2023 tax return received benefits (Last month
         rule) from assuming the taxpayer would be eligible to make HSA
         contributions throughout 2024, and the taxpayer’s eligibility
         changed

-  | Situations where you have additional income. This includes
     distributions that aren’t for qualified medical expenses, even if
     they aren’t subject to an additional 20% tax because the account
     beneficiary died, became disabled, or turned 65.

-  Taxpayers who received HSA contributions from their employer that are
   attributable to a different tax year than the year when the
   contribution was made. This includes:

   -  Taxpayers who received employer contributions in 2024 toward their
      2023 contribution limit
   -  Taxpayers who received employer contributions in 2025 toward their
      2024 contribution limit

-  Qualified HSA funding distributions

-  HSA distributions other than Normal Distributions - any distribution
   on 1099-SA where box 3 is not **1**

-  | Archer or Medicare Advantage Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs). These
     accounts are reported on the same income tax form as HSAs but are
     different.

-  Taxpayers who choose to file married filing separately and both
   taxpayers made contributions to their HSA

**Description**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For any state that has a state tax filing requirement, we will be
directing filers to a state tax filing tool after they submit their
federal taxes.

Some states allow filers to transfer their federal tax data to the state
tax filing tool, while others don’t (these filers will have to enter all
their data again in the state tool). In states that have data transfer,
TPs are sent back to Direct File to log in and transfer their data after
they begin their state tax return in the state tax filing tool.

**Navigation**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How do you navigate to this screen in the Direct File experience?

There are three areas of Direct File that are related to the state tax
filing experience: the eligibility screener, the confirmation screen
that is displayed after a filer submits their return, and the data
transfer screen which is displayed after a filer starts their state tax
return and is directed back to Direct File to transfer their data.

**Eligibility screener**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is a section in the eligibility screener that lists criteria for
being able to use DF for each state. This section includes conditions
that might prevent filers from using the state filing tool. If filers
will not be able to use the state tool, we discourage them from using
DF. These criteria are accessible from the state accordion on the first
step of the eligibility screener.

**Confirmation screen**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After a filer submits their return, they see a card on the confirmation
screen directing them to file their state taxes (if applicable).

-  For integrated states (with data transfer), this card takes filers to
   a screen that outlines the process for filing state taxes. They then
   see a button to go to the state filing tool.
-  For non-integrated states (without data transfer), the card on the
   confirmation screen has a button that takes the filer straight to the
   state filing tool.

**Data transfer screen**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After a filer begins their state tax return, they will be directed back
to DF to log in and approve a transfer of their federal tax return data
to the state filing tool.

“Return Status: Accepted” Required: Some states (AZ, ID, MD, NC, NJ, NY,
PA) require the federal tax return to be accepted before the filer can
transfer their data. If filers arrive on the data transfer screen before
their return is accepted, they are told they need to wait before they
can transfer. There is a button on this screen to refresh the page and
check their status again. They can only click this refresh button once
every 30 seconds (to keep from overloading the system).

“Returned Status: Pending” Allowed: Other states (IL, MA, NM, OR, WI)
will allow filers to transfer their data before their federal return is
accepted. We warn these filers that they may want to wait for acceptance
to make sure they don’t have to make changes to their state return (in
case of federal return rejection).

Once a filer clicks the “transfer data” button, they are taken back to
the state filing tool to continue their state return.

**Credit for Elderly or Disabled**
----------------------------------

.. _description-2:

**Description**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Credit for the Elderly or the Disabled is a new addition to Direct
File’s *Credits Section*. When any filer on the tax-return is determined
to be eligible for this tax credit, the user will encounter the set of
questions that allow a filer to further establish their eligibility.

This tax credit is available to taxpayers who are either elderly (65+)
or permanently and totally disabled, and whose income falls within
`income limits for this
credit <https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040sr#en_US_2023_publink11357od0e142>`__.
(External link:
https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040sr#en_US_2023_publink11357od0e142)

Credit for the Elderly or the Disabled is a *nonrefundable* tax credit.
This means that it can reduce your taxes, but it won’t reduce what you
owe below $0. In other words, it can’t give you a refund.

**Note:** This credit is not indexed for inflation. With its current
income limits, only a very narrow set of filers will be eligible to
claim this credit. Because most tax liability within these limits will
get offset by the standard deduction.

**Eligibility**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Must be 65+ or permanently and totally disabled
-  AGI must be within credit limits for filing status
-  Nontaxable income must be within credit limits for filing status

   -  This is nontaxable Social Security or other nontaxable pensions,
      annuities, or disability income.

How the math breaks down: Due to current standard deductions, only
filers with the following attributes will benefit from this credit.

-  Filing status: Single
-  Nontaxable income:

   -  If age 65+: Generally <$400, depending on income.
   -  If age <65: Generally <$1,350, depending on income.

-  AGI:

   -  If age 65+: $16,550 < x < $17,500
   -  If age <65: $14,600 < x < $17,500

**Requirements**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Elderly eligibility: 65+ years old as of January 1, <TY+1>
-  Disabled eligibility:

   -  Age: < 65 years old
   -  Retired on permanent and total disability by the end of <TY>
   -  Haven’t reached employer’s mandatory retirement age by January 1,
      <TY>
   -  Taxable Disability Income (from accident or health plans paid for
      by an employer): > $0
   -  Doctor’s statement: Required, but not filed. Kept as reference.

**Other product areas**
=======================

**About you**
-------------

In “About you”, Direct File asks questions about the primary taxpayer
that the IRS needs to know to generate the tax return. For example:

-  There are questions (like what state the taxpayer lives in) that help
   determine if the taxpayer’s tax situation fits the scope of the
   pilot.
-  There are questions (like age and blindness) that inform the
   taxpayer’s standard deduction.
-  There are questions (related to the taxpayer dependency test) that
   inform the taxpayer’s eligibility to claim a dependent.
-  There are questions (like age and citizenship) that inform the
   taxpayer’s eligibility to take certain tax credits or filing
   statuses.
-  There are also questions (like phone number and address) that are
   required for future IRS communication with the taxpayer.

Citizenship and Residency: we ask for the taxpayer’s citizenship and
residency status because the scope of the Direct File pilot is limited
to U.S. citizens and U.S. residents (including nonresidents who are
considered residents for tax purposes). If the taxpayer is not a U.S.
citizen or resident for tax purposes, we will direct them to other
filing options.

**Spouse**
----------

The “Spouse” section starts by asking questions about a taxpayer’s
marital situation. If they have a spouse, we use that information to
start to discern what filing status they qualify for. In “Spouse”,
Direct File asks questions about the taxpayer’s spouse that the IRS
needs to know to generate the tax return. For example:

-  There are questions (like what state the taxpayer’s spouse lives in)
   that help determine if the taxpayer’s tax situation fits the scope of
   the pilot.
-  There are questions (like spouse’s age and blindness) that inform the
   taxpayer’s standard deduction.
-  There are questions (related to claiming a spouse as a dependent or
   the spouse’s death) that inform the filing status they can claim.

Out of scope:

-  Registered domestic partnerships in community property states (Form
   8958)
