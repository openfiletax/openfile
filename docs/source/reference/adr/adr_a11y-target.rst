Accessibility targets
=====================

Context and Problem Statement
-----------------------------

In supporting a critical task for all U.S. residents, Direct File should
be accessible. This decision record sets a clear target for this phase
of development to meet those accessibility needs, and we expect to
exceed that target when feasible.

The U.S. describes its accessiblity requirements in `Section
508 <https://www.section508.gov/>`__ of the Rehabilitation Act.
`WCAG <https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/>`__ provides
the same for the internet at large with three levels of compliance (A,
AA, AAA), and it has increased in minor versions (2.0, 2.1, 2.2) over
the last 15 years. 508 and WCAG have a `very large
overlap <https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#E207.2>`__, and all
non-overlapping features unique to 508 are either irrelevant to this
project (e.g. manual operation and hardware) or out of this repo’s scope
(e.g. support channels). See the note in “More Information” below for
further information.

Given these equivalencies, all considered options are oriented toward
WCAG and achieve 508 compliance.

Considered Options
------------------

-  WCAG 2.0 A and AA (base 508)
-  WCAG 2.1 A and AA (508 superset)
-  WCAG 2.1 AA (enhanced superset)
-  WCAG 2.2 AA (forward-thinking)

Decision Outcome
----------------

Chosen option: “WCAG 2.2 AA (forward-thinking)”, because it ensures we
meet our baseline and exceed our goal

Consequences
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Good, because it establishes and exceeds 508 compliance
-  Good, because it is easy to remember the level expected of all
   elements (i.e. “what needs level A vs AA?”)
-  Good, because it challenges us to maximize WCAG at level AAA
-  Good, because it sets Direct File up with the latest a11y guidance
   for years to come
-  Good, because it doesn’t require any more work than WCAG 2.1 AA with
   our current design
-  Neutral, because it may require slighly more work than the bare
   minimum in the future
-  Neutral, some automated a11y tools don’t yet support 2.2 (as of Oct
   2023)

Confirmation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This decision to exceed 508 requirements is confirmed by the IRS’ 508
Program Office (IRAP) and by our Contracting Officer’s Representative,
Robin Coplen. IRAP will only ensure that the baseline is met (2.0 A and
AA). Project technical staff will continuously confirm adherence to this
decision’s specific version and level using accesibility evaluation
tools and manual evaluations when/where appropriate.

Pros and Cons of the Options
----------------------------

WCAG 2.0 A and AA (base 508)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Good, because it establishes 508 compliance
-  Good, because it is the easiest level to achieve
-  Bad, because omits updates and new tech since its publication 15
   years ago
-  Bad, because it does not exceed 508 compliance, as called for in our
   mission

WCAG 2.1 A and AA (508 superset)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Good, because it establishes 508 compliance
-  Good, because it is the easiest level to achieve for the latest
   published guidance
-  Bad, because it does not exceed 508 compliance, as called for in our
   mission, for the latest technologies like mobile devices

WCAG 2.1 AA (enhanced superset)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Good, because it establishes and exceeds 508 compliance
-  Good, because it is easy to remember the level expected of all
   elements (i.e. “what needs level A vs AA?”)
-  Good, because it challenges us to maximize WCAG at level AAA
-  Neutral, because it may require slighly more work than the bare
   minimum
-  Neutral, because it is an outdated version (see “more information”
   below)

WCAG 2.2 AA (forward-thinking)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Good, because it establishes and exceeds 508 compliance
-  Good, because it is easy to remember the level expected of all
   elements (i.e. “what needs level A vs AA?”)
-  Good, because it challenges us to maximize WCAG at level AAA
-  Good, because it sets Direct File up with the latest a11y guidance
   for years to come
-  Good, because it doesn’t require any more work than WCAG 2.1 AA with
   our current design
-  Neutral, because it may require slighly more work than the bare
   minimum in the future
-  Neutral, some automated a11y tools don’t yet support 2.2 (as of Oct
   2023)

More Information
----------------

-  For a complete description of Section 508, see
   https://www.access-board.gov/ict/

   -  WCAG 2.1 is a superset of WCAG 2.0, which will be the official 508
      version until Access Board approves an update, which can take
      years.

-  Most automated testing tools use version 2.1, so 2.0 compliance may
   appear as failing on tools and 2.2 may not be available. In 2.2’s
   case, it is largely backwards-compatible to 2.1 AA assuming all other
   criteria are met; therefore, if tools don’t reflect 2.2 we can treat
   their 2.1 AA conformance as equivalent.
-  Most testing tools are focused on level (A, AA, AAA) of compliance,
   so setting level AA as our target would be more memorable,
   programmable, and communicable.
-  How we achieve these targets, including tooling and processes, are
   described in a separate decision record.
-  WCAG 3 is still in a working draft phase, but it provides some
   guidance that may be truly better but technically non-compliant with
   2.2 due to backward incompatibility. For example, WCAG 3.0 uses a new
   `color contrast algorithm
   (APCA) <https://github.com/Myndex/SAPC-APCA/blob/master/documentation/WhyAPCA.md#why-the-new-contrast-method-apca/>`__
   that better matches reality. In our effort to exceed targets, we may
   want to use `this calculator <http://www.myndex.com/APCA/>`__ to test
   contrast among other things to allow us to both exceed our targets
   and be forward-thinking.
-  Things 508 covers that WCAG does not explicitly (TLDR: there are no
   issues):

   -  **Functional Performance Criteria**: at least one method must be
      provided allowing individuals with disabilities to interact with
      the product. Most of these are `explicitly covered by
      WCAG <https://www.section508.gov/content/mapping-wcag-to-fpc/>`__,
      but two are not:

      -  Without Speech - where speech is used for input, control or
         operation, ICT will provide at least one mode of operation that
         does not require user speech. We will not have any speech-based
         features built into this project, so this is not an issue.
      -  With Limited Reach and Strength - where a manual mode of
         operation is provided, ICT will provide at least one mode of
         operation that is operable with limited reach and limited
         strength. We will not have any manual operation methods, so
         this is not an issue.

   -  **Hardware and software**: 508 applies to websites like this, as
      well as hardware and operating systems. We are not building these,
      so this is not an issue.
   -  **Alternative Means of Communication**: 508 ensures that people
      with disabilities can effectively communicate and interact with
      support personnel. Examples of alternative means of communication
      include relay services for individuals with hearing impairments or
      providing accessible contact options for individuals with
      disabilities.
