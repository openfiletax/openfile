Accessibility testing methods
=============================

Context and Problem Statement
-----------------------------

In order to work in an agile fashion and ensure code changes meet both
design spec and our `accessibility target <adr_a11y-target.md>`__, we
should align on a consistent process to achieve this. As part of the
`accessibility review <adr_a11y-methods.md>`__ for each PR, the original
developer will do a first pass of both design and a11y review. This DR
covers how designers will be the second set of eyes on those user-facing
changes.

Considered Options
------------------

-  Review each PR locally before merging
-  Review all merged PRs for the current sprint in the deployment
   environment at the end of the sprint
-  Review entire application in the deployment environment every other
   sprint
-  Review entire application in the deployment environment when
   designers are available

Decision Outcome
----------------

Chosen option: “Review all merged PRs for the current sprint in the
deployment environment at the end of the sprint”, because it is the best
we can reasonably do given our comfort with the tools and time
available.

Consequences
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Good, because it maximizes coverage
-  Good, because it does a decent job of preventing issues from sneaking
   by for more than a sprint
-  Bad, because it requires extra time to create a new issue for each
   problem discovered
-  Bad, because it requires extra time to filter Github PRs by date

Confirmation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This decision is confirmed by all designers, as they will be doing this
work.

Pros and Cons of the Options
----------------------------

Review each PR locally before merging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Good, because it maximizes coverage of changes
-  Good, because it prevents almost all issues from sneaking by
-  Good, because feedback can go directly into the PR
-  Bad, because it requires frequent intervention by designers who may
   not be comfortable with necessary tools

Review all merged PRs for the ``{current | previous}`` sprint in the deployment environment at the ``{end | beginning}`` of the sprint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Good, because it maximizes coverage of changes
-  Good, because it does a decent job of preventing issues from sneaking
   by for more than a sprint
-  Bad, because it requires extra time to create a new issue for each
   problem discovered
-  Bad, because it requires extra time to filter Github PRs by date

Review entire application in the deployment environment every other sprint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Good, because it maximizes coverage of the final user experience (end
   to end)
-  Neutral, because it does a decent job of preventing issues from
   sneaking by for more than two sprints, but can mean more work is
   needed to recover from it
-  Bad, because it requires extra time and cognitive load to check what
   was merged and identifying in the environment what to review. It’s
   more likely in two vs one sprint that multiple PRs covered a certain
   page/feature, so filtering PRs by date is less useful.
-  Bad, because it requires extra time to create a new issue for each
   problem discovered

Review entire application in the deployment environment when designers are available
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Neutral, because it could maximize coverage of the final user
   experience (end to end), but only as much as the designer has time
   for
-  Bad, because lingering design/a11y debt can be harder to pay off the
   longer it lingers
-  Bad, because it requires extra time and cognitive load to check what
   was merged and identifying in the environment what to review. It’s
   higly likely that multiple PRs covered a certain page/feature, so
   filtering PRs by date is useless.
-  Bad, because it requires extra time to create a new issue for each
   problem discovered

More Information
----------------

-  The design review checklist is located in the PR template for the
   first option and in a `separate
   document <../design-review-process.md>`__ for all other options.
