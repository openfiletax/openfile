# How to generate a tsc perf build

1. Make sure that the normal lint steps run first to generate all the factgraph related stuff
2. `cd` into the package whose tsc build you'd like to test (probably df-client-app/)
3. Run `npx tsc --generateTrace ~/my-tsc-trace-output-directory` replacing the output directory with whatever you'd like
4. Open chrome, in the address bar type `chrome://tracing/`
5. Click the load button to open up the trace generated in step 3. (Should be a json file called `trace.json`)
